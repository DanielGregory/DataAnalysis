# 🚀 Rocket Launch Reliability Analysis

This project analyzes the success rate of small-lift launch vehicles following their first launch using real-world spaceflight data. The analysis is performed using Bayesian statistical modeling in **R**.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Launches.csv`: The dataset containing launch history and outcomes.
- `Data_Analysis_Report.ipynb`: The full analysis notebook, including data cleaning, visualization, and Bayesian modeling.
- `Data Analysis Report.pdf`: A comprehensive written report summarizing the analysis, methods, and conclusions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to evaluate how likely a small-lift launch vehicle is to succeed after its first launch, using a probabilistic approach. The analysis involves:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Posterior probability estimation using Bayesian inference
- Interpretation of success trends across different vehicles

## 📌 Technologies Used

- R (with libraries for Bayesian modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook (via R kernel)
- CSV data files

## 📄 Report Summary

The full results, including visualizations and model interpretation, are available in the `Data Analysis Report.pdf`. This includes:

- An overview of the dataset
- Methodology for Bayesian modeling
- Posterior probability distributions
- Conclusions on vehicle reliability

## 🧠 Motivation

This project was completed as part of a data analysis course, combining statistical inference with real-world space industry data.
